# StatPal API Integration - Complete Guide

## âœ… GREAT NEWS: Both UK and US Racing Data Are Working!

Your API key `5aad32df-dc2d-4222-9023-64f422f9071f` has access to both UK and US racing data!

## Correct Endpoints

### UK Racing
```
GET https://statpal.io/api/v1/horse-racing/live/uk?access_key=YOUR_KEY
```

### US Racing  
```
GET https://statpal.io/api/v1/horse-racing/live/usa?access_key=YOUR_KEY

**Important**: Use `usa` not `us` for American racing data!

## Usage with StatPal Service

```python
from statpal_service import StatPalService

service = StatPalService()

# Get UK races
uk_races = service.get_live_races('uk')

# Get US races (use 'us' - it will be converted to 'usa' internally)
us_races = service.get_live_races('us')

# Get race details

```
